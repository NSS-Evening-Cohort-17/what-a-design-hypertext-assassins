          My nextdoor neighbor was such a jerk! Always mowing the lawn at 7am on Saturday mornings, leaving garbage all over the backyard, playing loud Top 40 radio out of the windows after leaving the house, illegally double parking his golf cart and personally, I believe he is SELF-TANNER ABUSER. I hired Colin to move in across the street and let's just say after 6 weeks, my neightbor isn't a problem anymore. Totally worth the slow burn and let's be real: he had it coming - 666/10 would recommend!

          My tried & true methods include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Energy drain</li>
          <li>Emotional manipulation: I have psychic abilities that can manipulate people into regressing into emotions I can feed off.</li>
          <li>Empathy: I can ‘sense’ intense emotions from a distance, helping me find my prey.</li>
          <li>Shapeshifting: although not practiced often, energy vampires are capable of shapeshifting into animals. I can transform himself into a gecko.</li>

        <p class="ev--about__p">
          Looking for the perfect unassuming assassin? Then your search stops here, buckeroo. My name is Colin Robinson and I've been sucking out lifeforces for decades as an award winning energy vampire. My specialty is draining energy from others by boring them, annoying them, or making them feel awkward. Emotions of intense anger and awkwardness give an excess boost of energy to a vampire. Victims become physically tired and weakened when drained, and in extreme cases, they can faint, fall into comas or even expire. Whoopsie!
