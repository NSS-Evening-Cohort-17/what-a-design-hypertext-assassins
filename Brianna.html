<h1>Opps Did I Do That? 
    Assassination by Accident </h1>

                <p>
                    For secret assassination either simple or chase, the contrived
                    accident is the most effective technique. When successfully executed
                    it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated.
                    The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of
                    75 feet or more onto a hard surface.Elevator shafts, stair wells, 
                    unscreened windows and bridges will do the trick.
                    Other methods such as alcohol and automobile accidents are not as sufficient
                    or reliable.

<p>
The lady never even gave me her name. I had to contact her by chasing her down
in the middle of the street literally.

</p>

<h6>
I 0 out of 10 recommend this assasian. She was supposed to make the Assasination
look like an accident but it was a total FAIL. A complete waste of my money. 
</h6>

<p>
    She used a banana peel to make it look like my person had feel and broke his 
    neck. SERIOUSLY??? I Could have done that, and paying in PHO? Who does That?
